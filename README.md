# Leaf-Disease-Detection
In a study using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) for leaf disease detection from the Plant Village dataset, the CNN model outperformed the KNN model across all evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score). The study also employed Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) for model explainability. A user study revealed that farmers expressed distrust in both the AI and XAI models due to perceived inadequacies in predictions and explanations. However, valuable feedback from farmers highlighted areas for potential improvement to gain their trust.#
# Objectives

3. Implement CNN and KNN
4. Train and test CNN 
5. Train and test KNN
6. Evaluate the performance of both the models
7. Apply XAI technique on both the models in order to find the features responsible for the prediction
8. Design and execute a user study
